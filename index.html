          <h1>Travelling: Exploring Nature's Hilly</h1>
          <p>
            I love traveling to hilly areas where I can immerse myself in the local culture and interact with the people. These destinations offer not only breathtaking landscapes but also vibrant traditions and customs. Whether it's exploring traditional crafts in remote villages, participating in local festivals, or enjoying the hospitality of communities with rich cultural heritage, these trips provide a unique blend of natural beauty and cultural depth. Engaging with locals and experiencing their way of life adds a meaningful dimension to the journey, making every trip both memorable and enriching.
          </p>
          <p>
            The opportunity to engage with locals, whether through sharing meals, staying in homestays, or joining in communal activities, enriches my travel experience. Each journey becomes a blend of breathtaking natural beauty and deep cultural connection, making these travels both memorable and profoundly meaningful.

                Lord Muruga beckons you to come to Kurinji Andavar for he is the presiding deity, also called God of Hills. The temple is popular not only with devotees but, also with tourists that come here expecting to see the rare Kurinji flower.
